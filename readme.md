Created by: Andakara Athaya Sidiq (Solo) / 2200822 / Teknik Komputer 2022/ Batch 3

Overview: A JavaScript program that will solve definite and indefinite integration for polynomials using some basic and primitive methods. I know parsing would be the proper method for this program but I just can't xd.

## Package Used
1. readline
2. jshint

## Guide
I don't think thereâ€™s anything to add here,  the program is pretty self-explanatory to use.
